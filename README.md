## Data Sources

For the geographical boundaries of the different boroughs of New York City, we used the `nyc-boroughs.geojson` file provided by the course organizers in Moodle.

The trip dataset itself, which contains data about each ride, was downloaded from [https://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/](https://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/) under the "Trips" section. The dataset contains 12 files: `trip_data(1-12).csv`. Since the files are large, we decided to continue with only using the `trip_data_1.csv` file (2.4GB).

In the CSV file, each row represents one taxi ride's information, except for the first row, which is the header. Due to the large size of the file, we could not attach it to the Git repository nor the zip file uploaded to Moodle (100MB per file). It has to be manually downloaded from the previously provided link. We have also compressed it with 7z and uploaded it to a Google Drive: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZdUWt0ATyJrQbJEXSge7GNACusphhJoL/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZdUWt0ATyJrQbJEXSge7GNACusphhJoL/view) (347MB).

## Queries 
### Query 1 - Computing utilization, idle time per taxi
The dataset was processed to calculate the idle time for each taxi driver. Repartition was used to get all trips of the same driver. The window function was used to get the previous drop-off time for each driver. The idle time was calculated by subtracting the previous drop-off time from the pick-up time. Then the data frame was filtered based on the idle times (times greater than 4 hours were removed), also we excluded cases where pickup time was earlier than the prev_dropoff time, just to avoid overlapping. Finally, the sum of the idle time of each taxi driver was calculated. Then the total_idle_time, total_ride_duration, and total_time were used to compute utilization_rate.

*** We also computed an average utilization rate which is 0.4724117287691575.

### Query 2 - The average time it takes for a taxi to find its next fare(trip) per destination borough
This query calculates the average time a taxi waits for its next fare after dropping off a passenger in each borough. First, each trip is ordered by pickup time for each driver (hack_license), and the next pickup time is retrieved using a window function. The waiting time is then calculated as the difference between the next pickup and the previous dropoff time. To clean the data, rows with missing values are removed. To find waiting time, we look at the dropoff time and the next pickup time. If the difference is more than 4 hours, we do not consider them as an idle time, but as a time off. The average waiting time is then calculated for each dropoff borough, and borough codes are mapped to their names. The results are visualized in a bar plot, showing boroughs on the y-axis and their average waiting times in seconds on the x-axis.

Graph:

![average_waiting_time_by_borough](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/696828f3-e608-42df-bcd8-12a60ce89e93)


This bar chart shows the average taxi waiting time by drop-off borough, based on trip_data_1  file.
* Staten Island has the longest waiting time, higher than other boroughs. This likely means fewer taxis and lower demand.
* Manhattan has the shortest waiting time, which makes sense because of its high taxi availability and frequent ride requests.
* Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens fall in between, with Queens having slightly longer waits. This may be due to different demand levels and taxi availability.

Overall, the data suggests that busier areas like Manhattan have shorter waiting times, while quieter areas like Staten Island experience longer gaps between rides.

### Query 3 - The number of trips that started and ended within the same borough
In order to calculate how many taxi trips started and ended within the same borough, we filtered the given dataset to keep only trips where the pickup and dropoff borough were the same. Then data was grouped by the pickup borough to count the number of trips within each borough. First the boroughs were in the form of numerical codes, we created a DataFrame  borough_names_df  to give the borough the official names (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island). 

Graph: 

![same_borough_trips](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab37e4dc-089d-48be-b206-073b59203a4d)

From these results, based on the trip_data_1 file it is shown that the most same-borough trips are dominating in Manhattan, Staten Island and Bronx have the lowest number of same-borough trips.  This probably does not describe all the data, because we have taken a little of our whole dataset. 

### Query 4 - The number of trips that started in one borough and ended in another one
To analyze the trips between different boroughs, the dataset was filtered to count the number of trips where the pickup and dropoff locations were in different boroughs. We also grouped the data by pickup and dropoff borough and summed the number of such trips in every possible variation. The result, stored in different_borough_trips_df, represented the numbers of such trips. We again gave the boroughs the names instead of the numeric code. The result on the number of trips that started in one borough and ended in another one resulted in 1,586,098 trips based on the trip_data_1 file which had a total of 14,335,835 trips. 

Heatmap:

![different_boroughs_heatmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9c3eca5-52c5-40d8-a662-1cc6aa37dbc4)

This heatmap is visualizing the number of taxi trips between different boroughs in New York City. It is shown that the majority of inter-borough trips involve Manhattan, making it the central hub of travel. Most of them are 460,647 trips from Manhattan to Queens. Brooklyn and Queens also have significant inter-borough trips. Staten Island has the lowest number of inter-borough trips - this may be due to different demand levels and taxi availability.

### Conclusions
The project successfully analyzed New York City taxi data by applying structured data transformations and borough mapping. The results showed that the average taxi utilization rate was 47.24%, with an average idle time of 1798.42 seconds (approximately 30 mins). Manhattan had the shortest waiting time, while Staten Island had the longest, with an average idle time being 4 times longer than in Manhattan (638 vs 2674 seconds). Based on trip_data_1.csv file most same-borough trips occurred in Manhattan, while Staten Island and Bronx had the fewest. Inter-borough trips followed expected patterns, with high traffic between neighboring boroughs. These insights provide a clearer understanding of taxi movement and demand distribution in New York City.
